Although UQ makes an iCalendar / vCalendar file available of our timetables, it
cannot be subscribed to as you would subscribe to a normal calendar. Given that
some UQ schools seem prone to giving us timetable changes at rather short
notice, it would be useful to have the calendar auto-sync to our phones and
laptops.  This is what this software does. 

It is written using mod_perl2 and requires Apache2 and SQLite. If you just wish
to use this software, go to the website instead:

	http://mbbscalendar.fearthecow.net/

To install the software, you'll need to put this whole folder in /opt/, symlink
the apache config into /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/ - or just build the docker image.

Cheers,

Rob!
