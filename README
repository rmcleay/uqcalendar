Why?
----

Although the UQ School of Medicine makes an iCalendar / vCalendar file
available of our timetables, this file is broken in a number of ways. It also
cannot be subscribed to as you would subscribe to a normal calendar. Given that
the school seems prone to giving us timetable changes at rather short notice,
it would be useful to have the calendar auto-sync to our phones and laptops.
This is what this software does. 

It is written using mod_perl2 and requires Apache2 and MySQL. If you just wish
to use this software, go to the website instead:
