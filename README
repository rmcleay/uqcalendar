Although the UQ School of Medicine makes an iCalendar / vCalendar file
available of our timetables, this file is broken in a number of ways. It also
cannot be subscribed to as you would subscribe to a normal calendar. Given that
the school seems prone to giving us timetable changes at rather short notice,
it would be useful to have the calendar auto-sync to our phones and laptops.
This is what this software does. 

It is written using mod_perl2 and requires Apache2 and MySQL. If you just wish
to use this software, go to the website instead:

	http://mbbscalendar.fearthecow.net/

To install the software, you'll need to put this whole folder in /opt/, symlink
the apache config into /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/.

You then need to edit mysql_db.sql, and import it into MySQL to create the
database, and then edit the following files accordingly:

apache.conf
perl-lib/MBBS/DB.pm

Restart Apache, and you should be good to go!

Cheers,

Rob!
