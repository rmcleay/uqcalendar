	<p><b>New:</b> Now easy setup for <a href='ios.html'>iPhones and iPads</a>, and <a href="gcalandroid.html">Android and Google Calendar!</a></p>

<h2>What and Why:</h2>

<p> Although the school of medicine makes an iCalendar / vCalendar file
available of our timetables, this file is broken in a number of ways. It also cannot be subscribed to as you would subscribe to a normal calendar. Given that the school seems prone to giving us timetable change at rather short notice, it would be useful to have the calendar auto-sync to our phones and laptops. This is what this page does.
</p>

<p><b>This is probably not even beta quality software</b>. Your mileage may
vary. Don't blame me if you miss an exam. You get what you pay for.</p> 

	<h2>How to subscribe using Desktop Software:</h2>

<ol>
	<li>In iCal on your Mac (not tested elsewhere yet), click on the "Calendar"
	menu, then subscribe.</li>
       
	<li>Copy and paste the following URL into the box:
	<blockquote><a href='https://mbbscalendar.fearthecow.net/calendar/'>https://mbbscalendar.fearthecow.net/calendar/</a></blockquote>
	</li>
	<li>Enter your UQ username and password. You may also need to accept (hit continue) the SSL certificate. More on these below.</li>
	<li>Make sure to set the calendar to auto-update - e.g. hourly.</li>
	<li>Hit OK and enjoy your auto-syncing calendar that doesn't call everything "Live Lecture"!</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Note:</b> In order not to irritate the UQ SOM IT staff, this site will fetch a new calendar from the SOM no more than once every 3 hours. It will only grab the current week and next week's data. It will cache a uniquely salted (and thus irreversible) hash of your password to authenticate you to provide the calendar again in the meantime.</p>

<h2>If you can't subscribe to a https url:</h2>

<p>If iCal or your calendar program will not allow you to subscribe to an HTTPS calendar, then (at your own risk), you can choose to use a non-SSL version. <b>Your password will be transmitted in plain-text, so you use this at your own risk.</b> The URL to subscribe to instead is:</p>

	<blockquote>http://mbbscalendar.fearthecow.net/calendar-nonssl/</blockquote>




<h2>Security notes:</h2>

<p>This service requires your UQ username and password as it simulates a
web-browsing session to the SOM MBBS Timetable page to get your timetable data.
Ultimately, you have to trust that I am honest, handle your password correctly,
and that I won't keep a copy of it, pretend to be you, and change your degree in sinet to
be agricultural science.</p>

<p>Note, however, that I use this site myself, so I do have vested interest in
maintaining good security (plus, I also used to work as a sysadmin).</p>

<p><b>Technical guarantees:</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>I strongly recommend that you use the SSL version. It's the same encryption as your bank, except I'm just too cheap to buy a certificate, so you get a warning when you first set it up.</li>
	<li>I will never store your password in any format that is reversible. I use a salted hash function with a random salt using the SHA-1 algorithm.</li>
</ul>
